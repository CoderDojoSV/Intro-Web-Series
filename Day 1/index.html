    <h1>Welcome to the CoderDojo Web Workshop!</h1>

    <p>In these sessions, we will be learning to make websites using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. No previous experience is necessary, just have fun and be creative! <p>
    </p>
    <p> Today we will learn some of the most important HTML tags.  You can use this to share your favorite book or summer activity.  REMEMBER! When you are writing information about yourself, it's smart to keep your private information private.  Don't give your full name or where you can be found.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Set up
    </h2>
    <p>
      For our meetings, we will be using mozilla.org's web editor called Thimble.  It is at <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org">thimble.mozilla.org</a>.  You will need an account in order to save your web page you create today. If you are under 13, ask your parent to help.   
    </p>
    To get started
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org">thimble.mozilla.org</a></li>
      <li>Click on Sign Up in the upper right corner<br>(or Log In if you already created a mozilla account)</li>
      <li>Fill in the form</li>

<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>A web page is made up of the text you want to say, and many HTML elements, called tags, that are enclosed in angle brackets. These tags tell your web browser what to show.
HTML, and particularly HTML5, is used to give the structure and content of the page, but not specific appearance.  (Later tonight, we'll use css to change how it looks.)</p>
    <p>The paragraph below is an example of how you mark a paragraph in HTML, by surrounding it in opening <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;All web pages on the internet use HTML!&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Example - A Web Page About My Favorite Season</h3>
  <p>This bit of code:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My Favorite Season&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, I'd like to share about my favorite season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are four seasons in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;spring&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;summer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;fall&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;winter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My favorite season is summer, because I can go to the beach with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src="http://images.pinchit.com/deals/2012/04/16/012292aa53_1334616708_550.jpg" alt=""&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/1tOMKwv"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see my favorite sea animal.&lt;/p&gt;   
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>will produce a web page that looks like this:</p>
    <p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4042186/lesson1-sample.png" alt="demo"></p>
    <p>Check out the <a href="https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/jamwave/7089">live demo</a> to experiment yourself.</p>
    
    
<div>
  <h1>
    Your Story
  </h1>
  <h2>What is your favorite book?</h2>
  <h3>-OR- What was your favorite activity last summer?  Or favorite sport?</h3> 
</div>

  <p>Our project today gives you a chance to write a little about your interests.  </p>
  <p>Using some of the HTML tags we'll talk about, write a little about yourself and your favorite things.   Write just a little, because you want to use most of your time tonight learning how to make it look better, and you can decide what to say later.</p>
  <p>If you would rather write on a different topic, that's ok too.  Please don’t post your full name or address or even school, as these projects will be up on the internet for the whole world to see.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Start a new project at <a href="thimble.mozilla.org/editor/">thimble.mozilla.org/editor/</a> 
      <!--
The HTML section will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;JS Bin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
-->
  <p>You should delete all of the sample HTML! We will start with it completely blank.</p>

<h1>
  HTML
</h1>
    
  <p>Let’s learn a few tags to use on your web page! Most of the time you will have an opening tag and matching closing tag with some text in between.</p>
  <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoderDojoSV/Medallia-Web-Workshop/master/html%20tags%20pic.jpg" width="60%" alt="html tags"></p>

<h3>Heading Tag</h3>
  <p>
  The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used to make the text a heading.  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the biggest heading</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1&gt;My favorite book series is about Harry Potter&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>Add a heading to your page. Try changing the tag to an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> (and don’t forget to change the closing tag) - what changed? How many heading tags are there?</p>
    <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
    <p>If you type out text, it will be displayed all on one line. What if you want to break it up into paragraphs? That’s where the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag comes in.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1&gt;My favorite book series is about Harry Potter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd like to tell you about the my favorite book series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the book series starring Harry Potter, a young wizard who learns magic at Hogwarts, and who everyone hopes will defeat a very bad wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>Add a couple paragraphs to your web page about your favorite book.</p>
    
    <h3>List Tags</h3>
    <p>You can add a list to your story using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">
Here is a list of some of the Harry Potter books.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Harry Potter meets Percy Jackson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Hey, who put that there!
    </p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag (unordered list) tells the browser this is a list of items. The <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> (list item) tags are used around each list item.</p>
    <p>Add a list to your web page with other books you like, or places you want to go.  What happens if you change the ul tag to an ol? What do you think that stands for?</p>
    
    <h3>Tags Within Tags!</h3>
    <p>Lists are a little tricky because there is one tag within another one. Notice that the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag comes first and that there are <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags within it, before the closing <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tag. This can be used other places too!</p>
    <p>Try adding these tags to your page to see what they do: 
    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code><code>&lt;/strong&gt;</code></li>  
      <li><code>&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code></li>

    </ul>
    <p>Remember, they can be within other tags.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;First, I'd like to tell you about &lt;u&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the first story about my favorite character &lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Image Tags</h3>
    <p>This story would be a lot more interesting with pictures! Adding a picture to our story is simple, we just use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and tell it where our image is.</p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag has an attribute called <code>src</code> and this is where we tell it the url to the image we want to use in our story. Here is an example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag (notice that you don’t need a closing tag this time--the oldest tags are like that, including <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>code>):</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_wordmark.svg"&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>What if the image is too big for your page? You can tell it to be a certain size:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_wordmark.svg" width="350px"&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>Do you know what px means?</p>
    <p>Add some images to your web page that have to do with your favorites! Make sure any Google Images Searches have SafeSearch on.</p>
    
    <h3>Link Tags</h3>
    <p>One of the things that makes web pages so amazing for writing about things is you can <strong>link</strong> things together with other web pages on the internet and it is really easy to do!</p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag has an attribute called <code>href</code> and we will set that attribute equal to the url of the web page we want to link to.  Here is an example where I link the name Harry Potter to the web page about Harry Potter on Wikipedia:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>Add a link to your web page. Is there another book you like? Link to a website about it!</p>
    <h3>Finish Your Web Page</h3>
    <p>There are more HTML tags to try, but we now have the skills to make an exciting web page. Complete the content about your favorite book and we will learn some CSS to make the page look better!</p>
    
    
<h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>Next we are going to learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</a>,
      more commonly known as CSS. We are going to use CSS to improve the <em>look
      and feel</em> of our stories.</p>
    
    <h3><a id="What_is_CSS_169"></a>What is CSS?</h3>
    <p>CSS is a language that can be used to describe how HTML is supposed to look.
      The important distinction here is that HTML structures the content,
      while CSS controls how it looks.</p>
    <p><em>Let’s look at some CSS:</em></p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">body <span class="hljs-rules">{
  font-family: Arial;
  background-color:#FF6BC4;
}</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>If you paste the above code into the style.css panel in Thimble, what changes about your website? You might have to click the style.css file on the left side of Thimble page to show the CSS panel.</p>
    
    
    <h3><a id="How_CSS_Works_188"></a>How CSS Works</h3>
    <p>We can get an idea of what’s happening by looking at each line of the CSS.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For all <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags
        <ol>
          <li>Use <code>Arial</code> as the font</li>
          <li>Set the background color to <code>#FF6BC4</code> (A <strong><em>hex color</em></strong>. More on this later)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>CSS follows a basic pattern. First, we select the HTML elements we want to
      change the look of. Then, we say what aspects of their look we want to change.
      Take this snippet for example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">body <span class="hljs-rules">{
  font-family:Arial;
  background-color:#FF6BC4;
}</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>We are selecting all <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags (We only have 1),
      then saying we want to modify the font, background color, and foreground color.</p>
    <p>The part that selects the tags is called the <strong>selector</strong>, and each modification
      is called a <strong>declaration</strong>. A combination of a selector and any number
      of declarations is called a <strong>rule</strong>. A CSS file can contain as many rules as
      we want.</p>
    <p>Let’s break down the concepts of <strong>selectors</strong> and <strong>declarations</strong>.</p>
    
    
    <h3><a id="Selectors_218"></a>Selectors</h3>
    <p>So far we have seen an example selector for all body tags. How can you make a selector for all paragraph tags? Add it to your project, making the paragraphs have a different background color!</p>

    <h3><a id="Declarations_225"></a>Declarations</h3>
    <p>Declarations are the style modifications we apply in each CSS rule. There are two parts to each declaration: the <strong>property</strong> and the <strong>value</strong>. The pattern is:</p>
    <p><code>property: value;</code></p>
    <p>There are an amazing number of options for declarations in CSS - you can do just about anything you want! But let’s start with just a few. Can you add the following declarations to your page?</p>
    <pre><code>font-family: Arial;
text-align: center;
color: yellow;
background-color: black;
</code></pre>
