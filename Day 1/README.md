#Day 1: HTML and CSS

Today we will be learning to make websites using HTML and CSS. No previous experience is necessary, just have fun and be creative! We will be making web pages to help us write a web page about our favorite things, which we can show our friends and family.

We will use http://thimble.mozilla.com for creating, editing, and previewing our web page.


The notes and examples we will use can be seen here:

(You can click the [Reix] button and play with the HTML and CSS which we used to describe HTML and CSS.)


The files are also available permanently here in this github repository. (directly viewable here: http://rawgit.com/CoderDojoSV/Intro-Web-Series/master/Day%201/index.html )
