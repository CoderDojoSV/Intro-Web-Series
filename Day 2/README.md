#Day 2: More HTML and CSS

Today we will be continuing with more HTML and CSS, giving you more power to make awesome websites!


###Making Your Own Colors

There is a simple way to do colors in CSS, simply by typing in the color:

```background-color: green;```

But there are many more colors that we don't have names for. As we saw in the earlier example, it used a color #FF6BC4. That is a hex color - it combines red, blue, and green to make a very specific color. It will give you many many more options for colors to use on your web page.

In order to find the hex value for a specific color, go to [Color Picker](http://colorpicker.com/). Select the color you want and copy the hex value from the top of the screen.

If you are interested in learning how the computer knows that #FF6BC4 is that specific shade of pink, ask a mentor! It is really cool!
